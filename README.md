# Weather app #
## Description ##
The application has been implemented with angularjs and in a mobile-first approach. So it gives its best on small devices (one can use chrome developers tools' device toolbar).
## Requirements ##
* nodejs
* npm
## Build ##

```
#!shell
npm install 
gulp

```
## Run locally ##
Open index.html with google chrome
## Live demo ##
This app has been deployed on AWS S3 [link](http://my-weather-app.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/).
On S3 the brower's geolocation is disable since not running on https. If you run it locally the geolocation works.
